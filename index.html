      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        I am Jennifer Oluchukwu Odunze, a dedicated professional
        passionate about technology and education. Currently serving as a
        Programmes Officer at Aspilos Foundation in Abuja since February 2024, I
        lead program activities, provide mentorship, and foster innovative
        solutions to address societal issues. My journey with Aspilos Foundation
        began in June 2022 as a Project Officer, where I empowered individuals
        through front-end web development training. I hold a degree in Applied
        Biochemistry from Nnamdi Azikiwe University and a Diploma in Frontend
        Engineering from AltSchool Africa. Certified in web development and
        React, my skill set includes Frontend Development, Project Management,
        Mentorship, and Digital Marketing. Beyond my professional roles, I am an
        Ambassador for Women Techmakers, engaging in mentorship and educational
        content production. Committed to continuous learning and advocacy for
        Gender Diversity, I actively contribute to initiatives related to
        Frontend Innovation and Tech community engagement. I am driven by the
        belief in the transformative power of technology and education, seeking
        opportunities to make a positive impact in these fields.
